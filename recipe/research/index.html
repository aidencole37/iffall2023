    <h1>Red Beans and Rice</h1>
    <img src="01COOKING-REDBEANS-RICE2-master768.jpeg">
    <h2>Red beans and rice is an emblematic dish of Louisiana Creole cuisine traditionally made on Mondays with Kidney beans, vegetables, spices and pork bones as left over from Sunday dinner, cooked together slowly in a pot and served over rice. Meats such as ham, sausage, and tasso ham are also frequently used in the dish.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            1½ pound dried red beans (preferably New Orleans Camelia brand)
            <br>
            1 pound andouille sausage, sliced ½-inch thick (smoked sausage can also be used)
            <br>
            4 tablespoons olive oil
            <br>
            6 garlic cloves, minced
            <br>
            2 medium onions, finely diced
            <br>
            1 large rib celery, finely diced
            <br>
            1 medium green bell pepper, chopped
            <br>
            1½ teaspoons black pepper
            <br>
            ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
            <br>
            2 teaspoons salt
            <br>
            3 bay leaves
            <br>
            2 teaspoons dried basil
            <br>
            ¾ teaspoon rubbed sage
            <br>
            1 cup chopped fresh parsley
            <br>
            1 bunch fresh green onions, chopped
            <br>
            Cooked white long-grain rice, for serving
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <p>
            Step 1
            <br>
            In a large bowl, cover beans in water and soak for at least 4 hours or overnight. (Water should cover beans by at least an inch.)
            <br>
            <br>
            Step 2
            <br>
            In a large, heavy pot, brown sausage in 1 tablespoon of oil until slightly crisp. Add remaining oil, then the garlic and onions. Sauté over medium heat until onions become transparent and limp. Add celery and bell pepper and sauté for 5 minutes.
            <br>
            <br>
            Step 3
            <br>
            Pour soaked beans and water into the pot and bring to a simmer. Add black pepper, cayenne, salt and all herbs except parsley.
            <br>
            <br>
            Step 4
            <br>
            Cook until beans are softened, about 1½ to 2 hours. Taste and adjust seasonings.
            <br>
            <br>
            Step 5
            <br>
            Fifteen minutes before serving, remove 1 cup of beans to a bowl and, using a fork, mash them and stir back into the pot to enhance the creamy texture of the dish. Add parsley and green onions. Simmer about 15 minutes, taste and adjust seasoning, and add up to 1 cup more water if beans seem too thick. Remove bay leaves. Serve over white long-grain rice.
